            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>My name is Parker Hewett, and I am an MIS major at the Price College of Business, expected to graduate in 2024. During the past summer, I had the opportunity to work as an Industrial Engineer intern at SageNet in Tulsa, OK. This experience allowed me to shadow various employees, gaining insights into Project Management, Supply Chain Management, provisioning, and Customer Support. Additionally, I initiated a data catalog project in Sharepoint in collaboration with another intern.</p>
            <p>In 2020, I achieved the rank of Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America, demonstrating my commitment to personal growth and leadership. Currently, I am an active member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity at the University of Oklahoma, where I serve as the treasurer.</p>
